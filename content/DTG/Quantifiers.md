### Universal Quantifier

Universal quantifier states that the statements within its scope are true for every value of the specific variable. It is denoted by the symbol ∀∀.

∀xP(x)∀xP(x) is read as for every value of x, P(x) is true.

### Existential Quantifier

Existential quantifier states that the statements within its scope are true for some values of the specific variable. It is denoted by the symbol ∃∃.

∃xP(x)∃xP(x) is read as for some values of x, P(x) is true.

### Nested Quantifiers

If we use a quantifier that appears within the scope of another quantifier, it is called nested quantifier.

**Example**

- ∀ a∃bP(x,y)∀ a∃bP(x,y) where P(a,b)P(a,b) denotes a+b=0a+b=0
    
- ∀ a∀b∀cP(a,b,c)∀ a∀b∀cP(a,b,c) where P(a,b)P(a,b) denotes a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c
