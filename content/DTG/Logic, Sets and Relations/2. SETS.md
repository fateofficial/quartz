## Set - Definition

A set is an unordered collection of distinct objects, called elements or members of the set. A set is said to contain its elements. We write a ∈ A to denote that a is an element of the set A. The notation a ∉ A denotes that a is not an element of the set A.

**Example of Sets in Roster or Tabular Form**
The set V of all vowels in the English alphabet can be written as V = {a, e, i, o, u}.
The set O of odd positive integers less than 10 can be expressed by O = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.

The set is represented by listing all the elements comprising it. The elements are enclosed within braces and separated by commas.

### Set Builder Notation

Another way to describe a set is to use set builder notation. We characterize all those Extra elements in the set by stating the property or properties they must have to be members. The Examples general form of this notation is ${x ∣ x\:has\:property\:P}$ and is read “the set of all x such that x has property P.” For instance, the set O of all odd positive integers less than 10 can be written as

$O = \{x∣x$  is an odd positive integer less than $10\}$

$O = \{x ∈ Z+ ∣ x$ is odd and $x < 10\}$.

### Some Important Sets

**N** − the set of all natural numbers = {$1,2,3,4,...$}

**Z** − the set of all integers ={${...,−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3,...}$}

**Z+** − the set of all positive integers

**Q** − the set of all rational numbers

**R** − the set of all real numbers

**W** − the set of all whole numbers

## Cardinality of a Set

Cardinality of a set S, denoted by |S|, is the number of elements of the set. The number is also referred as the cardinal number. If a set has an infinite number of elements, its cardinality is ∞∞.

## Types of Sets

Sets can be classified into many types. Some of which are finite, infinite, subset, universal, proper, singleton set, etc.

**Finite Set**
A set which contains a definite number of elements is called a finite set.
$S=\{x|x∈N$ and $70>x>50\}$

### Infinite Set

A set which contains infinite number of elements is called an infinite set.

**Example** − S={x|x∈NS={x|x∈N and x>10}x>10}

### Subset

A set X is a subset of set Y (Written as X⊆YX⊆Y) if every element of X is an element of set Y.

**Example 1** − Let, X={1,2,3,4,5,6}X={1,2,3,4,5,6} and Y={1,2}Y={1,2}. Here set Y is a subset of set X as all the elements of set Y is in set X. Hence, we can write Y⊆XY⊆X.

**Example 2** − Let, X={1,2,3}X={1,2,3} and Y={1,2,3}Y={1,2,3}. Here set Y is a subset (Not a proper subset) of set X as all the elements of set Y is in set X. Hence, we can write Y⊆XY⊆X.

### Proper Subset

The term “proper subset” can be defined as “subset of but not equal to”. A Set X is a proper subset of set Y (Written as X⊂YX⊂Y) if every element of X is an element of set Y and |X|<|Y||X|<|Y|.

**Example** − Let, X={1,2,3,4,5,6}X={1,2,3,4,5,6} and Y={1,2}Y={1,2}. Here set Y⊂XY⊂X since all elements in YY are contained in XX too and XX has at least one element is more than set YY.

### Universal Set

It is a collection of all elements in a particular context or application. All the sets in that context or application are essentially subsets of this universal set. Universal sets are represented as UU.

**Example** − We may define UU as the set of all animals on earth. In this case, set of all mammals is a subset of UU, set of all fishes is a subset of UU, set of all insects is a subset of UU, and so on.

### Empty Set or Null Set

An empty set contains no elements. It is denoted by ∅∅. As the number of elements in an empty set is finite, empty set is a finite set. The cardinality of empty set or null set is zero.

**Example** − S={x|x∈NS={x|x∈N and 7<x<8}=∅

### Equal Set

If two sets contain the same elements they are said to be equal.

**Example** − If A={1,2,6}A={1,2,6} and B={6,1,2}B={6,1,2}, they are equal as every element of set A is an element of set B and every element of set B is an element of set A.

### Equivalent Set

If the cardinalities of two sets are same, they are called equivalent sets.

**Example** − If A={1,2,6}A={1,2,6} and B={16,17,22}B={16,17,22}, they are equivalent as cardinality of A is equal to the cardinality of B. i.e. |A|=|B|=3|A|=|B|=3

### Overlapping Set

Two sets that have at least one common element are called overlapping sets.

In case of overlapping sets −

- n(A∪B)=n(A)+n(B)−n(A∩B)n(A∪B)=n(A)+n(B)−n(A∩B)
    
- n(A∪B)=n(A−B)+n(B−A)+n(A∩B)n(A∪B)=n(A−B)+n(B−A)+n(A∩B)
    
- n(A)=n(A−B)+n(A∩B)n(A)=n(A−B)+n(A∩B)
    
- n(B)=n(B−A)+n(A∩B)n(B)=n(B−A)+n(A∩B)
    

**Example** − Let, A={1,2,6}A={1,2,6} and B={6,12,42}B={6,12,42}. There is a common element ‘6’, hence these sets are overlapping sets.

### Disjoint Set

Two sets A and B are called disjoint sets if they do not have even one element in common. Therefore, disjoint sets have the following properties −

- n(A∩B)=∅n(A∩B)=∅
    
- n(A∪B)=n(A)+n(B)n(A∪B)=n(A)+n(B)
    

**Example** − Let, A={1,2,6}A={1,2,6} and B={7,9,14}B={7,9,14}, there is not a single common element, hence these sets are overlapping sets.

## Venn Diagrams

Venn diagram, invented in 1880 by John Venn, is a schematic diagram that shows all possible logical relations between different mathematical sets.

## Set Operations

Set Operations include Set Union, Set Intersection, Set Difference, Complement of Set, and Cartesian Product.

### Set Union

The union of sets A and B (denoted by A∪BA∪B) is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B. Hence, A∪B={x|x∈A OR x∈B}A∪B={x|x∈A OR x∈B}.

**Example** − If A={10,11,12,13}A={10,11,12,13} and B = {13,14,15}{13,14,15}, then A∪B={10,11,12,13,14,15}A∪B={10,11,12,13,14,15}. (The common element occurs only once)

### Set Intersection

The intersection of sets A and B (denoted by A∩BA∩B) is the set of elements which are in both A and B. Hence, A∩B={x|x∈A AND x∈B}A∩B={x|x∈A AND x∈B}.

**Example** − If A={11,12,13}A={11,12,13} and B={13,14,15}B={13,14,15}, then A∩B={13}A∩B={13}.

![Set Intersection](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/discrete_mathematics/images/set_intersection.jpg)

### Set Difference/ Relative Complement

The set difference of sets A and B (denoted by A–BA–B) is the set of elements which are only in A but not in B. Hence, A−B={x|x∈A AND x∉B}A−B={x|x∈A AND x∉B}.

**Example** − If A={10,11,12,13}A={10,11,12,13} and B={13,14,15}B={13,14,15}, then (A−B)={10,11,12}(A−B)={10,11,12} and (B−A)={14,15}(B−A)={14,15}. Here, we can see (A−B)≠(B−A)(A−B)≠(B−A)

![Set Difference](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/discrete_mathematics/images/set_difference.jpg)

### Complement of a Set

The complement of a set A (denoted by A′) is the set of elements which are not in set A. Hence, A′={x|x∉A}A′={x|x∉A}.

More specifically, A′=(U−A)A′=(U−A) where UU is a universal set which contains all objects.

**Example** − If A={x|x belongstosetofoddintegers}A={x|x belongstosetofoddintegers} then A′={y|y doesnotbelongtosetofoddintegers}A′={y|y doesnotbelongtosetofoddintegers}

![Complement Set](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/discrete_mathematics/images/complement_set.jpg)

### Cartesian Product / Cross Product

The Cartesian product of n number of sets A1,A2,…AnA1,A2,…An denoted as A1×A2⋯×AnA1×A2⋯×An can be defined as all possible ordered pairs (x1,x2,…xn)(x1,x2,…xn) where x1∈A1,x2∈A2,…xn∈Anx1∈A1,x2∈A2,…xn∈An

**Example** − If we take two sets A={a,b}A={a,b} and B={1,2}B={1,2},

The Cartesian product of A and B is written as − A×B={(a,1),(a,2),(b,1),(b,2)}A×B={(a,1),(a,2),(b,1),(b,2)}

The Cartesian product of B and A is written as − B×A={(1,a),(1,b),(2,a),(2,b)}

## Power Set

Power set of a set S is the set of all subsets of S including the empty set. The cardinality of a power set of a set S of cardinality n is 2n2n. Power set is denoted as P(S)P(S).

**Example −**

For a set S={a,b,c,d}S={a,b,c,d} let us calculate the subsets −

- Subsets with 0 elements − {∅}{∅} (the empty set)
    
- Subsets with 1 element − {a},{b},{c},{d}{a},{b},{c},{d}
    
- Subsets with 2 elements − {a,b},{a,c},{a,d},{b,c},{b,d},{c,d}{a,b},{a,c},{a,d},{b,c},{b,d},{c,d}
    
- Subsets with 3 elements − {a,b,c},{a,b,d},{a,c,d},{b,c,d}{a,b,c},{a,b,d},{a,c,d},{b,c,d}
    
- Subsets with 4 elements − {a,b,c,d}{a,b,c,d}
    

Hence, P(S)=P(S)=

{{∅},{a},{b},{c},{d},{a,b},{a,c},{a,d},{b,c},{b,d},{c,d},{a,b,c},{a,b,d},{a,c,d},{b,c,d},{a,b,c,d}}{{∅},{a},{b},{c},{d},{a,b},{a,c},{a,d},{b,c},{b,d},{c,d},{a,b,c},{a,b,d},{a,c,d},{b,c,d},{a,b,c,d}}

|P(S)|=24=16|P(S)|=24=16

**Note** − The power set of an empty set is also an empty set.

|P({∅})|=20=1
