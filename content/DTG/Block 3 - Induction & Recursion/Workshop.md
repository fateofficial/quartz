Assume that Merge uses (exactly) $a + b - 1$ comparisons to combine two lists with $a$ and $b$ elements. Furthermore, assume that the length of the input list $L$ is $n = 2^k$. Prove by using induction on $k$, that Mergesort uses $n(\log_2(n) + 1) = 2^k(k + 1)$ comparisons to sort $L$. What type of induction did you use?

Base Case: $k=0$

When $k=0$, the list has one element ($n=1$). No comparisons are needed to sort a single element.
Let's check the formula:

$n = 2^0 = 1$
$\log_2(1) = 0$
So, $1(\log_2(1) + 1) = 1(0 + 1) = 1$

This matches because the base case of $n=1$ requires no comparisons.

Inductive Step
Assume that for a list of size $n = 2^m$, the number of comparisons is $2^m(m+1)$. This is the induction hypothesis.
We need to show that for $n = 2^m + 1$, the number of comparisons is $2^m + 1((m+1) + 1)$.
What happens when we double the list size?

Divide the list: When $n = 2^m + 1$, the list is split into two sublists, each of size $2^m$.
Sort each sublist: By the inductive hypothesis, sorting each sublist requires $2^m(m+1)$ comparisons.
Merge the sorted sublists: Merging two lists of size $2^m$ requires $2^m + 2^m - 1 = 2^{m+1} - 1$ comparisons.

Total Comparisons for $n = 2^m + 1$
The total number of comparisons is:
$$
2 \times 2^m(m + 1) + (2^{m+1} - 1)
$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$
2^{m+1}(m + 1) + 2^{m+1} - 1 = 2^{m+1}(m + 2) - 1
$$
Rearranging terms:
$$
2^{m+1}(m + 2) -1
$$
This does not match the formula $2^m + 1((m+1) + 1)$. There's an error in the problem statement or the inductive step.


Conclusion
The inductive step has a flaw and thus the conclusion cannot be reached.  There's an error in the problem statement or the inductive step.
This was an attempt at mathematical induction, where we assume the statement is true for $k=m$ and prove it for $k=m+1$.
